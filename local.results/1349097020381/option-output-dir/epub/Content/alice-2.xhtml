         <p>
            <i>Alice</i> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
            the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
            book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <span>"and what is <span id="d437e330" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2"></span> the use of a book,"</span>
            thought <i>Alice</i>, <span>"without pictures or
               conversation?"</span>
            
         </p>
         
         <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
            made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a
            daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
            when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. 
         </p>
         
         <p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did
            <i>Alice</i> think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear
            the <i>Rabbit</i>say to itself, <span>"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall
               be late!"</span> (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that
            she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
            natural); but when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its
               waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
            <i>Alice</i> started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that
            she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
            take out of it, and, <span id="d437e368" epub:type="pagebreak" title="3"></span> burning with curiosity, she ran
            across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
            large rabbit-hole under the hedge. 
         </p>
         
         <p>In another moment down went <i>Alice</i> after it, never once considering
            how in the world she was to get out again.
         </p>
         
         <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped
            suddenly down, so suddenly that <i>Alice</i> had not a moment to think
            about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. 
         </p>
         
         <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of
            time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen
            next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it
            was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
            noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there
            she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down B2 <span id="d437e385" epub:type="pagebreak" title="4"></span> a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled "ORANGE
            MARMALADE", but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to
            drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the
            cupboards as she fell past it. 
         </p>
         
         <p><span>"Well!"</span> thought <i>Alice</i> to herself, <span>"after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
               How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn"t say anything about
               it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" </span> (Which was very likely
            true.) 
         </p>
         
         <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end! <span>"I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?"</span> she said
            aloud. <span>"I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
               Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—" (for, you see,
               <i>Alice</i> had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons
               in the schoolroom, and though this was not a <em>very</em> good
               opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to
               <span id="d437e415" epub:type="pagebreak" title="5"></span>her, still it was good practice to say it over)
               "—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or
               Longitude I've got to?"</span> (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
            Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
         </p>
         
         <p>Presently she began again. <span>"I wonder if I shall fall right
               <em>through</em> the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among
               the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I
               think—"</span> (she was rather glad there <em>was</em> no one listening,
            this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) <span>" —but I
               shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,
               Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"</span> (and she tried to curtsey as
            she spoke—fancy <em>curtseying</em> as you"re falling through the air! Do
            you think you could manage it?) <span>"And what an ignorant little girl
               she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see
               it written up somewhere."</span></p>
         <span id="d437e440" epub:type="pagebreak" title="6"></span>
         
         <p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so <i>Alice</i> soon began
            talking again. <span>"<i>Dinah</i> 'll miss me very much
               to-night, I should think!"</span> (<i>Dinah</i> was the cat.) <span>"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.
               <i>Dinah</i> my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
               no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
               like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"</span> And here
            <i>Alice</i> began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to
            herself, in a dreamy sort of way, <span>"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat
               bats?"</span> and sometimes, <span>"Do bats eat cats?"</span> for, you
            see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she
            put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
            was walking hand in hand with <i>Dinah</i>, and saying to her very
            earnestly, <span>"Now, <i>Dinah</i>, tell me the truth: did you
               ever eat a bat?"</span> when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap
            of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
         </p>
         <span id="d437e482" epub:type="pagebreak" title="7"></span>
         
         <p><i>Alice</i> was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
            moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
            passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was
            not a moment to be lost: away went <i>Alice</i> like the wind, and was
            just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, <span>"Oh my ears
               and whiskers, how late it's getting!"</span> She was close behind it when she
            turned the corner, but the <i>Rabbit</i>was no longer to be seen: she
            found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
            from the roof.
         </p>
         
         <p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
            <i>Alice</i> had been all the way down one side and up the other,
            trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever
            to get out again.
         </p>
         
         <p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;
            there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was
            that it might belong to one of the <span id="d437e507" epub:type="pagebreak" title="8"></span> doors of the hall;
            but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any
            rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came
            upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door
            about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to
            her great delight it fitted!
         </p>
         <img src="images/alice03a.png" alt="&#xA;                    Alice finding tiny door behind curtain&#xA;                " />
         
         <p><i>Alice</i> opened the door and found that it led into a small passage,
            not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
            into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark
            hall, and wander about among those beds of bright <span id="d437e516" epub:type="pagebreak" title="9"></span> flowers
            and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the
            doorway; <span>"and even if my head would go through,"</span> thought poor
            <i>Alice</i>, <span>"it would be of very little use without
               my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I
               could, if I only know how to begin."</span> For, you see, so many
            out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that <i>Alice</i> had begun to
            think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
         </p>
         
         <p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the
            table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of
            rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little
            bottle on it, ("which certainly was not here before," said <i>Alice</i>,)
            and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME"
            beautifully printed on it in large letters.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little <i>Alice</i>
            was not going to do <em>that</em>
            <span id="d437e545" epub:type="pagebreak" title="10"></span>in a hurry. <span>"No, I'll look first,"</span> she
            said, <span>"and see whether it’s marked 'poison' or not:"</span> for she
            had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
            eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
            <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught
            them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and
            that if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually
            bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
            "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
         </p>
         <img src="images/alice04a.png" alt="&#xA;                    Alice taking “Drink Me” bottle&#xA;                " />
         
         <p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked "poison," <span id="d437e569" epub:type="pagebreak" title="11"></span> so <i>Alice</i> ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it
            had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
            turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
         </p>
         
         <hr />
         
         
         <p><span>"What a curious feeling!"</span> said <i>Alice</i>, <span>"I must be shutting up like a telescope."</span></p>
         
         <p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened
            up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little
            door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to
            see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about
            this; <span>"for it might end, you know,"</span> said <i>Alice</i>
            to herself, <span>"in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
               what I should be like then?"</span> And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
            candle is like after the candle is blown out, <span id="d437e598" epub:type="pagebreak" title="12"></span> for she
            could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
         </p>
         
         <p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the
            garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found
            she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for
            it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly
            through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the
            table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying,
            the poor little thing sat down and cried.
         </p>
         
         <p><span>"Come, there’s no use in crying like that!"</span> said
            <i>Alice</i> to herself, rather sharply; <span>"I advise you
               to leave off this minute!"</span> She generally gave herself very good advice,
            (though she very seldom followed it,) and sometimes she scolded herself so
            severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box
            her own ears for having cheated herself <span id="p13" epub:type="pagebreak" title="13"></span> in
            a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was
            very fond of pretending to be two people. <span>"But it’s no use
               now,"</span> thought poor <i>Alice</i>, <span>"to pretend to be
               two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make <em>one</em>
               respectable person!"</span></p>
         
         <p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she
            opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words "EAT ME" were
            beautifully marked in currants. <span>"Well, I’ll eat it,"</span> said
            <i>Alice</i>, <span>"and if it makes me grow larger, I can
               reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door;
               so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which
               happens!"</span></p>
         
         <p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, <span>‘Which way?
               Which way?’</span>, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way
            it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
            size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but
            <i>Alice</i> had got so much into the <span id="p14" epub:type="pagebreak" title="14"></span> way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,
            that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
         </p>
         
         <p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>

         <p>The Pool of Tears</p>
         <img src="images/alice05a.png" alt="&#xA;                    Alice stretched tall&#xA;                " />
         
         <p>"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried <i>Alice</i> (she was so much surprised,
            that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); "now I'm
            opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!" (for when
            she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were
            getting so far off). "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder <span id="p16" epub:type="pagebreak" title="16"></span>who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
            I'm sure <em>I</em> shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to
            trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; -but I must be
            kind to them," thought <i>Alice</i>, "or perhaps they won't walk the way I
            want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. "They must go by the
            carrier," she thought; "and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own
            feet! And how odd the directions will look!
         </p>
         
         <div xml:space="preserve">
            <span>Alice's Right Foot, Esq.</span><br />
            <span>    Hearthrug,</span><br />
            <span>        Near the fender,</span><br />

         <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!"</p>
         
         <p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more
            than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried
            off to the garden door.
         </p>
         <span id="p17" epub:type="pagebreak" title="17"></span>
         
         <p>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look
            through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than
            ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
         </p>
         
         <p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said <i>Alice</i>, "a great girl
            like you," (she might well say this), "to go on crying in this way! Stop this
            moment, I tell you!" But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears,
            until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching
            half down the hall.
         </p>
         
         <p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she
            hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit
            returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a
            large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
            himself as he came, "Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if
            I've kept her waiting!" <i>Alice</i> felt so desperate that she was ready
            to ask help <span id="p18" epub:type="pagebreak" title="18"></span> of any one; so, when the
            <i>Rabbit</i>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, "If you
            please, sir-" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the
            fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
         </p>
         <img src="images/alice06a.png" alt="&#xA;                    Giant Alice watching Rabbitrun away&#xA;                " />
         <span id="p19" epub:type="pagebreak" title="19"></span>
         
         <p><i>Alice</i> took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
            kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: "Dear, dear! How queer
            everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if
            I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this
            morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm
            not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,
            <em>that's</em> the great puzzle!" And she began thinking over all the
            children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have
            been changed for any of them.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and
            mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know
            all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides,
            <em>she's</em> she, and I'm I, and-oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll
            try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is
            twelve, <span id="p20" epub:type="pagebreak" title="20"></span> and four times six is thirteen, and
            four times seven is-oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However,
            the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the
            capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome-no,
            <em>that's</em> all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for
            Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little-'" and she crossed her hands on her
            lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded
            hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-

         <p>"I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor <i>Alice</i>, and her
            eyes filled with tears again as she went on, "I must be Mabel after all, and I
            shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to
            play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about
            it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads
            down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I
            then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up:
            if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else' -but, oh dear!" cried
            <i>Alice</i>, with a sudden burst of tears, "I do wish they
            <em>would</em> put their heads down! I am so <em>very</em> tired of
            being all alone here!"
         </p>
         
         <p>As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she
            had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.
            "How <em>can</em> I have done that?" she thought. "I must be growing
            small<span id="p22" epub:type="pagebreak" title="22"></span> again." She got up and went to the
            table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess,
            she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
            found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it
            hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
         </p>
         
         <p>"That <em>was</em> a narrow escape!" said <i>Alice</i>, a good deal
            frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
            existence; "and now for the garden!" and she ran with all speed back to the
            little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
            key was lying on the glass table as before, "and things are worse than ever,"
            thought the poor child, "for I never was so small as this before, never! And I
            declare it's too bad, that it is!"
         </p>
         
         <p>As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was
            up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen
            into the sea, "and in <span id="p23" epub:type="pagebreak" title="23"></span>that case I can go
            back by railway," she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
            her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the
            English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children
            digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind
            them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of
            tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
         </p>
         <img src="images/alice07a.png" alt="&#xA;                    Alice in pool of tears&#xA;                " />
         
         <p>"I wish I hadn't cried so much!" said <i>Alice</i>, as she swam about,
            trying to find her way out.<span id="p24" epub:type="pagebreak" title="24"></span> "I shall be
            punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That
            <em>will</em> be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer
            to-day."
         </p>
         
         <p>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and
            she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a
            walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she
            soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Would it be of any use, now," thought <i>Alice</i>, "to speak to this
            mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
            likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying." So she began: "O
            Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about
            here, O Mouse!" (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a
            mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in
            her brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse- <span id="p25" epub:type="pagebreak" title="25"></span>of a
            mouse-to a mouse-a mouse-O mouse!" The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively,
            and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span>"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,"</span> thought Alice; <span>"I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the
               Conqueror."</span> (For, with all her knowledge of history, <i>Alice</i>
            had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began
            again: <span>"Ou est ma chatte?"</span> which was the first sentence in
            her French lesson-book. The <i>Mouse</i>gave a sudden leap out of the
            water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. <span>"Oh, I beg your
               pardon!"</span> cried <i>Alice</i> hastily, afraid that she had hurt the
            poor animal's feelings. <span>"I quite forgot you didn't like
               cats."</span></p>
         
         
         <p><span>"Not like cats!"</span> cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate
            voice. <span>"Would <em>you</em> like cats if you were me?"</span></p>
         
         <p><span>"Well, perhaps not,"</span> said <i>Alice</i> in a soothing
            tone: <span>"don't be angry about it. And yet <span id="p26" epub:type="pagebreak" title="26"></span>I wish I could show you our cat <i>Dinah</i>: I
               think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a
               dear quiet thing,"</span>
            <i>Alice</i> went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily <img src="images/alice08a.png" alt="&#xA;                        Alice with Mousein pool of tears " /> about
            in the pool, <span>"and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking
               her paws and washing her face-and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse-and
               she's such a capital one for catching mice-oh, I beg your pardon!"</span> cried
            <i>Alice</i> again, for this time the <i>Mouse</i>was bristling
            all over, and she felt certain it must be really <span id="p27" epub:type="pagebreak" title="27"></span> offended. <span>"We won't talk about her any more if
               you'd rather not."</span></p>
         
         
         <p><span>"We indeed!"</span> cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the
            end of his tail. <span>"As if I would talk on such a subject! Our
               family always <em>hated</em> cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let
               me hear the name again!"</span></p>
         
         
         <p>"I won't indeed!" said <i>Alice</i>, in a great hurry to change the subject
            of conversation. "Are you-are you fond-of-of dogs?" The <i>Mouse</i>did
            not answer, so <i>Alice</i> went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little
            dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
            know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw
            them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things-I can't
            remember half of them-and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so
            useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and-oh dear!"
            cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, "I'm afraid I've offended it <span id="d437e961" epub:type="pagebreak" title="28"></span> again!" For the <i>Mouse</i>was swimming away from her as
            hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
         </p>
         
         <p>So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk
            about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!" When the
            <i>Mouse</i>heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
            face was quite pale (with passion, <i>Alice</i> thought), and it said in a
            low trembling voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
            history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and
            animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an
            Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. <i>Alice</i> led the way, and
            the whole party swam to the shore.

         <img src="images/alice10a.png" alt="&#xA;                    Mouse telling story to birds and Alice&#xA;                " />
         
         <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank-the birds with
            draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all
            dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
         </p>
         
         <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation
            about this, <span id="d437e1001" epub:type="pagebreak" title="30"></span> and after a few minutes it seemed quite
            natural to <i>Alice</i> to find herself talking familiarly with them, as
            if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with
            the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, "I am older than you,
            and must know better;" and this <i>Alice</i> would not allow without
            knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age,
            there was no more to be said.
         </p>
         
         <p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out,
            "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! <em>I'll</em> soon make you dry
            enough!" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
            <i>Mouse</i>in the middle. <i>Alice</i> kept her eyes anxiously
            fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry
            very soon.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"Ahem!" said the <i>Mouse</i>with an important air, "are you all ready?
            This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!
            '<i>William the Conqueror</i>, whose cause was <span id="p31" epub:type="pagebreak" title="31"></span> favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English,
            who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and
            conquest. <i>Edwin</i> and <i>Morcar</i>, the earls of Mercia and
            Northumbria-'"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Ugh!" said the Lory, with a shiver.</p>
         
         <p>"I beg your pardon?" said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: "Did you
            speak?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Not I!" said the Lory hastily.</p>
         
         
         <p>"I thought you did," said the Mouse. -"I proceed. '<i>Edwin</i> and
            <i>Morcar</i>, the earls of <i>Mercia</i> and <i>Northumbria</i>, declared for him: and even
            <i>Stigand</i>, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it
            advisable-'"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Found <em>what</em>?" said the Duck.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Found <em>it</em>," the Mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you know
            what 'it' means."
         </p>
         
         <p>"I know what 'it' means well enough, when I find a thing," said the Duck: "it's
            generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?"
         </p>
         
         <p>The <i>Mouse</i>did not notice this question, but <span id="p32" epub:type="pagebreak" title="32"></span> hurriedly went on, "'-found it advisable to go with Edgar
            Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was
            moderate. But the insolence of his Normans-' How are you getting on now, my
            dear?" it continued, turning to <i>Alice</i> as it spoke.
         </p>
         
         <p>"As wet as ever," said <i>Alice</i> in a melancholy tone: "it doesn't seem
            to dry me at all."
         </p>
         
         <p>"In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "I move that the
            meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies-"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Speak English!" said the Eaglet. "I don't know the meaning of half those long
            words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And the Eaglet bent
            down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "was, that the best
            thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."
         </p>
         
         <p>"What <em>is</em> a Caucus-race?" said Alice; not that she wanted much to
            know, but the Dodo <span id="p33" epub:type="pagebreak" title="33"></span> had paused as if it
            thought that <em>somebody</em> ought to speak, and no one else seemed
            inclined to say anything.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." (And, as you
            might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the
            Dodo managed it.)
         </p>
         
         
         <p>First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the exact shape doesn't
            matter," it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and
            there. There was no "One, two, three, and away," but they began running when
            they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when
            the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and
            were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out "The race is over!" and they
            all crowded round it, panting, and asking, "But who has won?"
         </p>
         
         <p>This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it
            sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its <span id="p34" epub:type="pagebreak" title="34"></span> forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
            in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
            said, "<em>everybody</em> has won, and all must have prizes."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"But who is to give the prizes?" quite a chorus of voices asked.</p>
         
         <p>"Why, <em>she</em>, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to <i>Alice</i>
            with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
            confused way, "Prizes! Prizes!"
         </p>
         
         <p><i>Alice</i> had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
            pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got
            into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all
            round.
         </p>
         
         <p>"But she must have a prize herself, you know," said the Mouse.</p>
         
         
         <p>"Of course," the Dodo replied very gravely. "What else have you got in your
            pocket?" he went on, turning to Alice.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Only a thimble," said <i>Alice</i> sadly.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Hand it over here," said the Dodo.</p>
         <span id="p35" epub:type="pagebreak" title="35"></span>
         <img src="images/alice09a.png" alt="&#xA;                    Dodo presenting thimble&#xA;                " />
         
         <p>Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the
            thimble, saying "We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;" and, when it
            had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
         </p>
         <span id="p36" epub:type="pagebreak" title="36"></span>
         
         <p><i>Alice</i> thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so
            grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to
            say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
         </p>
         
         <p>The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as
            the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones
            choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they
            sat down again in a ring, and begged the <i>Mouse</i>to tell them
            something more.
         </p>
         
         <p>"You promised to tell me your history, you know," said <i>Alice</i>, "and
            why it is you hate-C and D," she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would
            be offended again.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the Mouse, turning to <i>Alice</i>,
            and sighing.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span>It <em>is</em> a long tail, certainly,"</span> said
            <i>Alice</i>, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; <span>"but why do you call it sad?"</span> And she kept on puzzling about
            it while the <i>Mouse</i>was speaking, <span id="p37" epub:type="pagebreak" title="37"></span> so that her idea of the tale was something like this:-

         <p>"You are not attending!" said the <i>Mouse</i>to <i>Alice</i>
            severely. "What are you thinking of?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"I beg your pardon," said <i>Alice</i> very humbly: "you had got to the
            fifth bend, I think?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"I had <em>not</em>!" cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
         </p>
         
         <p>"A knot!" said <i>Alice</i>, always ready to make herself useful, and
            looking anxiously about her. "Oh, do let me help to undo it!"
         </p>
         
         <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.
            "You insult me by talking such nonsense!"
         </p>
         
         <p>"I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor Alice. "But you're so easily offended, you
            know!"
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The <i>Mouse</i>only growled in reply.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Please come back and finish your story!" <i>Alice</i> called after it; and
            the others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do!" but the
            <i>Mouse</i>only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
            quicker.
         </p>
         
         <p>"What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of
            sight; <span id="p39" epub:type="pagebreak" title="39"></span> and an old Crab took the opportunity
            of saying to her daughter "Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to
            lose <em>your</em> temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!" said the young Crab, a
            little snappishly. "You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!"
         </p>
         
         <p>"I wish I had our <i>Dinah</i> here, I know I do!" said <i>Alice</i>
            aloud, addressing nobody in particular. "She'd soon fetch it back!"
         </p>
         
         <p>"And who is <i>Dinah</i>, if I might venture to ask the question?" said the
            Lory.
         </p>
         
         <p><i>Alice</i> replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her
            pet: "<i>Dinah</i>'s our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching
            mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
            she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"
         </p>
         
         <p>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds
            hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully,
            remarking, "I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't <span id="p40" epub:type="pagebreak" title="40"></span> suit my throat!" and a Canary called out in a
            trembling voice to its children, "Come away, my dears! It's high time you were
            all in bed!" On various pretexts they all moved off, and <i>Alice</i> was
            soon left alone.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I wish I hadn't mentioned <i>Dinah</i>!" she said to herself in a
            melancholy tone. "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the
            best cat in the world! Oh, my dear <i>Dinah</i>! I wonder if I shall ever
            see you any more!" And here poor <i>Alice</i> began to cry again, for she
            felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
            little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half
            hoping that the <i>Mouse</i>had changed his mind, and was coming back to
            finish his story.
