                <p louis:style="#d104e1">
                    <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
                    the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
                    book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"and what is <pagebreak value="2" louis:style="#d104e1"/> the use of a book,"</d>
                    thought <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"without pictures or
                        conversation?"</d>
                </p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1"> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
                    made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a
                    daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
                    when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. </p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">There was nothing so <emph louis:style="#d104e1">very</emph> remarkable in that; nor did
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> think it so <emph louis:style="#d104e1">very</emph> much out of the way to hear
                    the <name louis:style="#d104e1">Rabbit</name>say to itself, <d ref="rabbit" louis:style="#d104e1">"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall
                        be late!"</d> (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that
                    she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
                    natural); but when the Rabbit actually <emph louis:style="#d104e1">took a watch out of its
                        waistcoat-pocket</emph>, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that
                    she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
                    take out of it, and, <pagebreak value="3" louis:style="#d104e1"/> burning with curiosity, she ran
                    across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
                    large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">In another moment down went <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> after it, never once considering
                    how in the world she was to get out again.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped
                    suddenly down, so suddenly that <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> had not a moment to think
                    about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. </p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1"> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of
                    time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen
                    next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it
                    was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
                    noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there
                    she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down B2 <pagebreak value="4" louis:style="#d104e1"/> a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled "ORANGE
                    MARMALADE", but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to
                    drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the
                    cupboards as she fell past it. </p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Well!"</d> thought <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> to herself, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
                        How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn"t say anything about
                        it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" </d> (Which was very likely
                    true.) </p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1"> Down, down, down. Would the fall <emph louis:style="#d104e1">never</emph> come to an end! <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?"</d> she said
                    aloud. <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
                        Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—" (for, you see,
                            <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons
                        in the schoolroom, and though this was not a <emph louis:style="#d104e1">very</emph> good
                        opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to
                            <pagebreak value="5" louis:style="#d104e1"/>her, still it was good practice to say it over)
                        "—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or
                        Longitude I've got to?"</d> (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
                    Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">Presently she began again. <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"I wonder if I shall fall right

                        the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I

                    she spoke—fancy <emph louis:style="#d104e1">curtseying</emph> as you"re falling through the air! Do
                    you think you could manage it?) <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"And what an ignorant little girl

                            <name louis:style="#d104e1">Dinah</name> my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
                        no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
                        like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"</d> And here
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to
                    herself, in a dreamy sort of way, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat
                        bats?"</d> and sometimes, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Do bats eat cats?"</d> for, you
                    see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she
                    put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
                    was walking hand in hand with <name louis:style="#d104e1">Dinah</name>, and saying to her very
                    earnestly, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Now, <name louis:style="#d104e1">Dinah</name>, tell me the truth: did you
                        ever eat a bat?"</d> when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap
                    of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>
                <pagebreak value="7" louis:style="#d104e1"/>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
                    moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
                    passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was
                    not a moment to be lost: away went <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> like the wind, and was
                    just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, <d ref="rabbit" louis:style="#d104e1">"Oh my ears
                        and whiskers, how late it's getting!"</d> She was close behind it when she
                    turned the corner, but the <name louis:style="#d104e1">Rabbit</name>was no longer to be seen: she
                    found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
                    from the roof.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> had been all the way down one side and up the other,
                    trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever
                    to get out again.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;
                    there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was
                    that it might belong to one of the <pagebreak value="8" louis:style="#d104e1"/> doors of the hall;
                    but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any
                    rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came
                    upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door
                    about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to
                    her great delight it fitted!</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> opened the door and found that it led into a small passage,

                    into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark
                    hall, and wander about among those beds of bright <pagebreak value="9" louis:style="#d104e1"/> flowers
                    and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the
                    doorway; <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"and even if my head would go through,"</d> thought poor
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"it would be of very little use without

                        could, if I only know how to begin."</d> For, you see, so many
                    out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> had begun to
                    think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the
                    table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of
                    rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little
                    bottle on it, ("which certainly was not here before," said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>,)
                    and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME"
                    beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>
                    was not going to do <emph louis:style="#d104e1">that</emph>
                    <pagebreak value="10" louis:style="#d104e1"/>in a hurry. <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"No, I'll look first,"</d> she
                    said, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"and see whether it’s marked 'poison' or not:"</d> for she
                    had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
                    eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
                        <emph louis:style="#d104e1">would</emph> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught
                    them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and
                    that if you cut your finger <emph louis:style="#d104e1">very</emph> deeply with a knife, it usually
                    bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
                    "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>
                <object xml:id="img_4" src="images/alice04a.png" srctype="image/png" louis:style="#d104e1">

                    had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
                    turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"What a curious feeling!"</d> said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"I must be shutting up like a telescope."</d></p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened
                    up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little
                    door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to
                    see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about
                    this; <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"for it might end, you know,"</d> said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>
                    to herself, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
                        what I should be like then?"</d> And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
                    candle is like after the candle is blown out, <pagebreak value="12" louis:style="#d104e1"/> for she
                    could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the
                    garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found
                    she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for
                    it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly
                    through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the
                    table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying,
                    the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Come, there’s no use in crying like that!"</d> said
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> to herself, rather sharply; <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"I advise you
                        to leave off this minute!"</d> She generally gave herself very good advice,
                    (though she very seldom followed it,) and sometimes she scolded herself so
                    severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box
                    her own ears for having cheated herself <pagebreak value="13" xml:id="p13" louis:style="#d104e1"/> in
                    a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was
                    very fond of pretending to be two people. <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"But it’s no use
                        now,"</d> thought poor <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"to pretend to be
                        two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make <emph louis:style="#d104e1">one</emph>
                        respectable person!"</d></p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she
                    opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words "EAT ME" were
                    beautifully marked in currants. <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Well, I’ll eat it,"</d> said
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"and if it makes me grow larger, I can
                        reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door;
                        so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which
                    happens!"</d></p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">‘Which way?
                        Which way?’</d>, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way
                    it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
                    size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> had got so much into the <pagebreak value="14" xml:id="p14" louis:style="#d104e1"/> way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,
                    that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>

                    she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were
                    getting so far off). "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder <pagebreak value="16" xml:id="p16" louis:style="#d104e1"/>who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?

                <p louis:style="#d104e1">And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. "They must go by the

                    ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, "a great girl

                <p louis:style="#d104e1">After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she
                    hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit
                    returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a
                    large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to

                    not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,
                        <emph louis:style="#d104e1">that's</emph> the great puzzle!" And she began thinking over all the
                    children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have
                    been changed for any of them.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and
                    mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know
                    all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides,
                        <emph louis:style="#d104e1">she's</emph> she, and I'm I, and-oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll
                    try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is
                    twelve, <pagebreak value="20" xml:id="p20" louis:style="#d104e1"/> and four times six is thirteen, and
                    four times seven is-oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However,
                    the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the
                    capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome-no,
                        <emph louis:style="#d104e1">that's</emph> all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for
                    Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little-'" and she crossed her hands on her
                    lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded
                    hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-</p>

                    shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to
                    play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about
                    it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads
                    down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I
                    then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up:
                    if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else' -but, oh dear!" cried
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, with a sudden burst of tears, "I do wish they
                        <emph louis:style="#d104e1">would</emph> put their heads down! I am so <emph louis:style="#d104e1">very</emph> tired of
                    being all alone here!"</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she
                    had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.
                    "How <emph louis:style="#d104e1">can</emph> I have done that?" she thought. "I must be growing
                        small<pagebreak value="22" xml:id="p22" louis:style="#d104e1"/> again." She got up and went to the
                    table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess,
                    she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
                    found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it
                    hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"That <emph louis:style="#d104e1">was</emph> a narrow escape!" said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, a good deal
                    frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
                    existence; "and now for the garden!" and she ran with all speed back to the
                    little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
                    key was lying on the glass table as before, "and things are worse than ever,"
                    thought the poor child, "for I never was so small as this before, never! And I
                    declare it's too bad, that it is!"</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was
                    up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen
                    into the sea, "and in <pagebreak value="23" xml:id="p23" louis:style="#d104e1"/>that case I can go
                    back by railway," she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
                    her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the
                    English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children
                    digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind
                    them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of
                    tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.</p>
                <object xml:id="img_7" src="images/alice07a.png" srctype="image/png" louis:style="#d104e1">
                    <p louis:style="#d104e1"><name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> in pool of tears</p>
                </object>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"I wish I hadn't cried so much!" said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, as she swam about,
                    trying to find her way out.<pagebreak value="24" xml:id="p24" louis:style="#d104e1"/> "I shall be
                    punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That
                        <emph louis:style="#d104e1">will</emph> be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer
                    to-day."</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and
                    she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a
                    walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she
                    soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Would it be of any use, now," thought <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, "to speak to this
                    mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
                    likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying." So she began: "O
                    Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about
                    here, O Mouse!" (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a
                    mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in
                    her brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse- <pagebreak value="25" xml:id="p25" louis:style="#d104e1"/>of a
                    mouse-to a mouse-a mouse-O mouse!" The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively,
                    and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,"</d> thought Alice; <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the
                        Conqueror."</d> (For, with all her knowledge of history, <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>
                    had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began
                    again: <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Ou est ma chatte?"</d> which was the first sentence in
                    her French lesson-book. The <name louis:style="#d104e1">Mouse</name>gave a sudden leap out of the
                    water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"Oh, I beg your
                        pardon!"</d> cried <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> hastily, afraid that she had hurt the

                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><d ref="mouse" louis:style="#d104e1">"Not like cats!"</d> cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate

                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><d ref="mouse" louis:style="#d104e1">"Well, perhaps not,"</d> said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> in a soothing

                    <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily <object xml:id="img_8" src="images/alice08a.png" srctype="image/png" louis:style="#d104e1">

                        she's such a capital one for catching mice-oh, I beg your pardon!"</d> cried
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> again, for this time the <name louis:style="#d104e1">Mouse</name>was bristling
                    all over, and she felt certain it must be really <pagebreak value="27" xml:id="p27" louis:style="#d104e1"/> offended. <d ref="mouse" louis:style="#d104e1">"We won't talk about her any more if

                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><d ref="mouse" louis:style="#d104e1">"We indeed!"</d> cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the
                    end of his tail. <d ref="mouse" louis:style="#d104e1">"As if I would talk on such a subject! Our
                        family always <emph louis:style="#d104e1">hated</emph> cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let

                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"I won't indeed!" said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, in a great hurry to change the subject
                    of conversation. "Are you-are you fond-of-of dogs?" The <name louis:style="#d104e1">Mouse</name>did
                    not answer, so <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little
                    dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
                    know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw
                    them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things-I can't
                    remember half of them-and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so
                    useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and-oh dear!"
                    cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, "I'm afraid I've offended it <pagebreak value="28" louis:style="#d104e1"/> again!" For the <name louis:style="#d104e1">Mouse</name>was swimming away from her as
                    hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk
                    about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!" When the
                    <name louis:style="#d104e1">Mouse</name>heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
                    face was quite pale (with passion, <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> thought), and it said in a
                    low trembling voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
                    history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1">It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and
                    animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an
                    Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> led the way, and
                    the whole party swam to the shore.</p>

                    dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation
                    about this, <pagebreak value="30" louis:style="#d104e1"/> and after a few minutes it seemed quite
                    natural to <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> to find herself talking familiarly with them, as
                    if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with
                    the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, "I am older than you,
                    and must know better;" and this <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> would not allow without
                    knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age,
                    there was no more to be said.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out,
                    "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! <emph louis:style="#d104e1">I'll</emph> soon make you dry
                    enough!" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the

                    advisable-'"</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Found <emph louis:style="#d104e1">what</emph>?" said the Duck.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Found <emph louis:style="#d104e1">it</emph>," the Mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you know
                    what 'it' means."</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"I know what 'it' means well enough, when I find a thing," said the Duck: "it's
                    generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?"</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">The <name louis:style="#d104e1">Mouse</name>did not notice this question, but <pagebreak value="32" xml:id="p32" louis:style="#d104e1"/> hurriedly went on, "'-found it advisable to go with Edgar
                    Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was
                    moderate. But the insolence of his Normans-' How are you getting on now, my
                    dear?" it continued, turning to <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> as it spoke.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"As wet as ever," said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> in a melancholy tone: "it doesn't seem
                    to dry me at all."</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "I move that the
                    meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies-"</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Speak English!" said the Eaglet. "I don't know the meaning of half those long
                    words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And the Eaglet bent
                    down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "was, that the best
                    thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"What <emph louis:style="#d104e1">is</emph> a Caucus-race?" said Alice; not that she wanted much to
                    know, but the Dodo <pagebreak value="33" xml:id="p33" louis:style="#d104e1"/> had paused as if it
                    thought that <emph louis:style="#d104e1">somebody</emph> ought to speak, and no one else seemed
                    inclined to say anything.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." (And, as you
                    might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the
                    Dodo managed it.)</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1">First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the exact shape doesn't
                    matter," it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and
                    there. There was no "One, two, three, and away," but they began running when
                    they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when
                    the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and
                    were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out "The race is over!" and they
                    all crowded round it, panting, and asking, "But who has won?"</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it
                    sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its <pagebreak value="34" xml:id="p34" louis:style="#d104e1"/> forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
                    in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
                    said, "<emph louis:style="#d104e1">everybody</emph> has won, and all must have prizes."</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"But who is to give the prizes?" quite a chorus of voices asked.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Why, <emph louis:style="#d104e1">she</emph>, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>
                    with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
                    confused way, "Prizes! Prizes!"</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
                    pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got
                    into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all
                    round.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"But she must have a prize herself, you know," said the Mouse.</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Of course," the Dodo replied very gravely. "What else have you got in your
                    pocket?" he went on, turning to Alice.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Only a thimble," said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> sadly.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Hand it over here," said the Dodo.</p>
                <pagebreak value="35" xml:id="p35" louis:style="#d104e1"/>
                <object xml:id="img_10" src="images/alice09a.png" srctype="image/png" louis:style="#d104e1">
                    <p louis:style="#d104e1">Dodo presenting thimble</p>
                </object>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the
                    thimble, saying "We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;" and, when it
                    had finished this short speech, they all cheered.</p>
                <pagebreak value="36" xml:id="p36" louis:style="#d104e1"/>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so
                    grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to
                    say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as
                    the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones
                    choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they
                    sat down again in a ring, and begged the <name louis:style="#d104e1">Mouse</name>to tell them
                    something more.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"You promised to tell me your history, you know," said <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, "and
                    why it is you hate-C and D," she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would
                    be offended again.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the Mouse, turning to <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>,
                    and sighing.</p>

                <p louis:style="#d104e1"><d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">It <emph louis:style="#d104e1">is</emph> a long tail, certainly,"</d> said
                        <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name>, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; <d ref="alice" louis:style="#d104e1">"but why do you call it sad?"</d> And she kept on puzzling about

                    pet: "<name louis:style="#d104e1">Dinah</name>'s our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching
                    mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
                    she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds
                    hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully,
                    remarking, "I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't <pagebreak value="40" xml:id="p40" louis:style="#d104e1"/> suit my throat!" and a Canary called out in a
                    trembling voice to its children, "Come away, my dears! It's high time you were
                    all in bed!" On various pretexts they all moved off, and <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> was
                    soon left alone.</p>
                <p louis:style="#d104e1">"I wish I hadn't mentioned <name louis:style="#d104e1">Dinah</name>!" she said to herself in a
                    melancholy tone. "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the
                    best cat in the world! Oh, my dear <name louis:style="#d104e1">Dinah</name>! I wonder if I shall ever
                    see you any more!" And here poor <name louis:style="#d104e1">Alice</name> began to cry again, for she
                    felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
                    little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half
                    hoping that the <name louis:style="#d104e1">Mouse</name>had changed his mind, and was coming back to
                    finish his story.</p>
